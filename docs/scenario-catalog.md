# Playable scenario catalog

STATUS: NINE PUBLIC SCENARIOS; EIGHT TEXT-ONLY + CALL CENTER TEXT/VOICE WITH TWO INTERNAL VARIANTS

The nine types in Proposal v6 section 4.1.7.1 are available through the authenticated scenario catalog. Templates have fictional content, backend transitions and explicit decision assessments. Scam templates retain warning evidence, early safe exit and validated critical simulated actions. NORMAL_CALL instead uses neutral evidence and zero critical rules. The non-SMS templates are version 1; SMS / Phishing uses version 4. Historical SMS versions 1–3 stay available for old sessions. All new templates use categorical [Decision Evaluation](decision-evaluation.md).

| Category | Template ID | Practised risk |
|---|---|---|
| Call Center | `call-center-scam` (stable historical ID) | NORMAL_CALL legitimate fictional appointment or SCAM_CALL caller impersonation |
| Investment | `investment-scam` | Guaranteed returns and a withdrawal fee |
| Romance | `romance-scam` | Relationship pressure and an urgent money request |
| E-commerce | `ecommerce-scam` | Off-platform payment to an unverified shop |
| SMS / Phishing | `sms-phishing-demo` | Parcel message, suspicious link and credentials |
| Task | `task-scam` | Upfront deposit to unlock earnings |
| Fake loan | `fake-loan-scam` | Untrusted loan app and excessive device access |
| Recovery | `recovery-scam` | A supposed refund helper seeking remote control |
| Job | `job-scam` | Upfront training fee and unverifiable employer |

The new scenarios share a small, reviewed state pattern but have distinct role, contact claim, pressure, evidence, request, safe response and critical rule. The backend maps public option IDs to pinned template choices. Free text and AI responses remain nonauthoritative. The mock provider now uses the selected scenario's context, and the real OpenAI adapter remains unverified due to the known 429 credit blocker.

For the eight new templates with publicActionBindings, the action list shows progression
only after required checkpoint/event guards are satisfied. SMS retains its original catalog
bindings and may expose a progress request that Core rejects until its guards pass.
The early safe stop is available at first contact. Backend guards always apply, including crafted requests.

Call Center uses one public card and a neutral public title/description for both variants.
The stable historical scenario ID is retained to preserve old session/start identities.
Backend selection uses crypto.randomInt(2), with an injected selector for deterministic tests.
The persisted session is authoritative: same owner/scenario/startId replays without reroll;
concurrent starts may select differently but the losing insert loads the database winner.
NORMAL_CALL is an additional immutable version tuple, not a rewrite of SCAM_CALL v1.
Browser start DTOs reject variant/callType/seed/probability; AI receives the chosen context only.
NORMAL_CALL uses a fictional library appointment, D1 context verification, neutral W1,
D2 fictional non-sensitive scheduling, S1 normal termination/known callback channel.
See [approved normal-call assessment](decision-evaluation.md) and [Voice](voice.md).

Tests exercise the catalog's nine distinct categories, each new template's full safe path, early safe exit, reviewed choice and validated critical action, plus an authenticated HTTP start/result path outside SMS. No real MySQL migration or live AI/voice service is claimed by these tests.

Recovery adds nine multi-turn/high-confidence candidate authority tests and conditional
fresh-client MySQL safe-path regression tests for all eight new version-1 templates plus
SMS versions 3/4. Legacy SMS versions 1/2 have separate compatibility round-trip tests.
MySQL and real browser execution remain NOT RUN; see [Recovery verification](recovery-verification.md).
